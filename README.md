Please only use these notebooks for educational purposes, to learn from my mistakes and examples. On that note, these code snippets are far from the best way to solve these problems; they are 'a' way to do it. There are more elegant solutions, I'm sure, but this was a learing process for me - as it should be for anyone who reads through it.
